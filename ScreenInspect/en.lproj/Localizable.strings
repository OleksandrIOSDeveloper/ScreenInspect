Our test will display various colors and patterns on your screen, allowing you to identify any dead pixels that may be present.

How to use:

1. Make sure your screen is as clean as can be. If it is not, you might mistake dust or dirt for a dead pixel. To prepare your screen to be tested for dead pixels, grab a piece of soft cloth, preferably a high-density one. Then, gently and carefully rub every inch of your screen and make sure it is crystal clear.

2. Click on the test-button to start testing your screen for dead pixels.

3. Click on the \"Got it\" button then you end up testing your display.";
